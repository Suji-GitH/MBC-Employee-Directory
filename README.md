## Overview

```
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
